    <p>Introducing the IntelliSun Table!</p>
    <p> Reflecting on our Senior Design I project selection, our team opted the "Smart Building" project, aiming to integrate support for student mental health and eco-friendliness. Consequently, we conceptualized the Smart Solar Table, addressing the prevalent issue of student mental health struggles. We discovered that spending time outdoors and practicing mindfulness can significantly alleviate stress and anxiety. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As students' needs and technology use grow, outdoor seating becomes a crucial element, combating the prevalent issue of device battery life and the lack of external charging ports. Many outdoor tables lack these ports, limiting students to indoor charging options and restricting their outdoor time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our solution, the IntelliSun - Smart Solar Table, not only provides charging flexibility for studentsâ€™ gadgets but also fosters mental well-being by offering comfortable outdoor seating and an interactive LCD touchscreen monitor. This monitor consolidates various resources from our website, such as UH Alert Updates, CAPS services, and a mindfulness timer, keeping students informed and relaxed. Adapting to available sunlight, the table is energy-efficient and eco-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
        We plan to propose this innovative idea to the UH campus faculty, emphasizing the uniqueness of this student-created solution over external companies. We, as students, believe we have a better understanding of our peers' necessities and preferences. Beyond the scope of this course, our team is passionate about refining this project further and contributing to the UH community's overall well-being.
